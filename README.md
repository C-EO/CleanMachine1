### Hello, Welcome to my README

Thanks for viewing my GitHub, if you would contribute to my projects it would mean a lot!
My code may not be the cleanest (although my name implies), but if it works, it works.

I am someone who loves to use a Raspberry Pi  (What I write most of my code on) or just a linux machine such as an x86 Linux Mint computer and although find it challenging I love to learn Computer Science and Programming!

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python3, C, Bash, HTML, CSS and PHP 
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with adding more examples for others in my Python-Code and Website-Code repos
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: /dev/null or create an issue at [Issue Page of this repo](https://github.com/CleanMachine1/CleanMachine1/issues) and I will reply as soon as I see it
