### Hello, Welcome to my README

Thanks for viewing my GitHub, if you would contribute to my projects it would mean a lot!
My code may not be the cleanest (although my name implies), but if it works, it works.

I only use GNU/Linux as my OS and for my computers I use Raspberry Pi and ThinkPad.

I love to program and learning all about computers!

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python 3, C, Bash, HTML, CSS and a small amount of PHP but not a lot
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with adding more examples for others in my Python-Code and Website-Code Repositories
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: /dev/null or create an issue at [Issue Page of this repo](https://github.com/CleanMachine1/CleanMachine1/issues) and I will reply as soon as I see it
- âš¡ Fun Fact: The world will end on January 19th 2038 according to Unix Epoch
- ðŸ’¬ Favorite Quote: A computer is like air conditioning. It becomes useless when you open windows - Linus Torvalds
