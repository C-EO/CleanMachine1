### Hello, Welcome to my README

Thanks for viewing my github, if you would contribute to my projects it would mean a lot!
My code may not be the cleanest, but if it works, it works.

I am someone who loves to use a Raspberry Pi (What I write most of my code on) and although find it challenging, love to learn Computer Science and Programming!

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python3, C, Bash, HTML, CSS and PHP 
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with adding more examples for others in my Python-Code and Website-Code repos 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: /dev/null or create an issue at [Issue Page of this repo](https://github.com/CleanMachine1/CleanMachine1/issues)
